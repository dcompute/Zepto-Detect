# Zepto.Detect

Extends [Zepto.js](https://github.com/madrobby/zepto) with a `detect` and 
`device` objects. Each of which provides a quick and easy way to test a variety
of browser client features, or device types. Allows you to easily detect HTML5
features, or react to various device types,

## Attribution
A majority of the tests within the `detect` object are from Mark Pilgrim's
